# Password-Strength-Detector
    # This is a password strength detector, in which the user inputs a password and its strength is evaluated by the amount of groups there are (Lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters) in the password, and by its length. There's also an auto-generated password if the user asks for it by typing ("X" or "x").
